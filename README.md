# Page scroll progress bar
This code snippet is just an implementation of the progress bar that follows a scrollable element and start observing the space covered while scrolling; the scrollable could be a scrollable element or the global window, depends on how you want it to behave. Here we choosed the #app element so that when the user reaches the end of it, the progress bar will be 100% filled.
