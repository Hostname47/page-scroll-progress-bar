            <p id="sub-title">Here, the progress bar will follow the scrollable element (determined in the js file) and start observing the space covered while scrolling; the scrollable could be a scrollable element or the global window, depends on how you want it to behave. Here we choosed the #app element so that when the user reaches the end of it, the progress bar will be 100% filled.</p>

                <p>Do not go gentle into that good night,</p>
                <p>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;</p>
                <p>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

                <p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,</p>
                <p>Because their words had forked no lightning they</p>
                <p>Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright</p>
                <p>Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,</p>
                <p>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,</p>
                <p>And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,</p>
                <p>Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

                <p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight</p>
                <p>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,</p>
                <p>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
                <br>
                <p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,</p>
                <p>Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.</p>
                <p>Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
